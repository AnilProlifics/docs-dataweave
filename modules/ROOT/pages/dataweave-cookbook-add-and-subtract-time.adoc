This DataWeave example shows multiple addition and subtraction operations that
deal with date and time types.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The examples use:

* `as` function to coerce a String to Period type
* `P<date>T<time>` for the Period data type, which provides designators for years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds +
For example, `|P2Y9M1D|` refers to a period of two years, nine months, and one day, and `|PT5H4M3S|` indicates a time period of five hours, four minutes, and three seconds.

Note that the behavior of `o: |2019-10-01| - |2018-09-23|` changed in Mule 4.3.0. DataWeave 2.3.0, which is supported by Mule 4.3.0, returns `"o": "PT8952H"`. DataWeave 2.2.0, which is supported by Mule 4.2.0, returns `"o": "P1Y8D"`. To restore the 2.2.0 behavior, you can set the `-M-Dcom.mulesoft.dw.date_minus_back_compatibility=true`. However, the setting does not affect the Preview window in Studio. For guidance with this setting in Studio and on-prem deployments, see xref:4.3@mule-runtime::mule-app-properties-system.adoc[System Properties]. For CloudHub deployments, see xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub-manage-props.adoc[Manage Properties for Applications on CloudHub].
