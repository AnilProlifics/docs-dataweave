= What's New in DataWeave

DataWeave 2.5 is bundled with Mule 4.5. The 2.5 version of DataWeave introduces some new features.

== Versioning Behavior in DataWeave

DataWeave now supports backward compatibility with previous 2.x versions of DataWeave through compatibility flags and syntax-level support:

* Compatibility flags are a set of DataWeave xref:dataweave-system-properties.adoc[DataWeave system properties] that enable you to retain specific DataWeave behavior at the Mule application level. The flags are valid for specified DataWeave versions and expire in a future version of DataWeave. Flags change behavior based on the value of the Mule `minMuleVersion` system property, which corresponds to a DataWeave version. See xref:feature-flagging.adoc[] for details.
//2.5 DOC MERGED: https://github.com/mulesoft/docs-dataweave/pull/214/files

* Syntax-level support is available at the script level through the `%dw` directive (see xref:dataweave-language-introduction.adoc#dw_header[DataWeave Scripts]). Setting the directive to an earlier version of DataWeave avoids any syntax-breaking changes when the DataWeave runtime engine runs the script. This script-level setting enables you to retain earlier behavior in some scripts while using the latest behavior in others.

For detail, see xref:dataweave-versioning-behavior.adoc[].

== Supported Formats

DataWeave now supports the ProtoBuf format and extends its XML support to DTD.

* Protocol Buffers (Protobuf): This format is typically used with gRPC, the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. See xref:dataweave-formats-protobuf.adoc[].

* DTD for XML: DataWeave can read and create cXML. However, the DTDs remain disabled for security reasons. See xref:dw-xml.adoc[].
//TODO: Does this related to the parseDtd flag?
//TODO: How does this relate to compatibility flags?
//From Lische: https://salesforce-internal.slack.com/archives/C011SNL2469/p1671213207700189


== Reusing DataWeave Types

In addition to loading types from custom DataWeave modules and mappings, DataWeave now can load types defined through JSON schemas, XML schemas, and Java classes.

//TODO: VERIFY XREF AND ANCHOR IN NEW DOC
See xref:dataweave-type-system.adoc#reusing-types[Reusing Types] in the DataWeave type system documentation


== Specifying Type Parameters

See "Specify Type Parameters" in xref:dataweave-functions-lambdas.adoc[].

* Typing enhancements that allow for reuse of type definitions from other sources:
** Type parameters in a function call.  //TODO: ADD anchored link to section.
See "Type Parameters Definition" in xref:dataweave-functions.adoc[].
//TODO: ADD anchored link to section.
//From ANA: Type parameters in function calls (@Andrés Radunsky): This is a very
//          advanced scenario where typed parameters, or generics, will now be able
//          to be declared at the function call level.  So one can say
//          myFunc<String>()  to signal that the generic in myFunc<T>() should
//          be a String. In the past, generics were always inferred which led
//          to some type checking errors. Because this required a syntax change,
//          it will only be available to scripts declaring %dw 2.5  or higher
//          (in the future) as their desired version.
//github MERGE (type parameter application):
//             https://github.com/mulesoft/docs-dataweave/pull/215/files

** Type selector expression //TODO: Clarify.
//From ANA: Type selector expression (@Martín Cousido): Users will be able to
//          navigate through type definitions to define DW types, so from a
//          complex type you can select a nested part as a new definition.
// * See Google doc listed in Slack at https://salesforce-internal.slack.com/archives/C011SNL2469/p1672164627375259: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLNh_FDnRIPG_nC4IRzBnN2Pr79d0tuvI6shZ12EcKc/edit#heading=h.epfq33bmp8h8


* Memory management
//TODO: NOT Customer Facing, BUT should we mention that there are
//      improvements in 2.5 and where they can expect to see them?
//From ANA: Mule memory service integration: Mule is launching a
//          new memory service in 4.5 which centralized all memory
//          usage to provide a single observability point. Within the
//          context of Mule, we had to start using this service to obtain
//          memory buffers and such. We are assuming Mule will document
//          this but we might want to add a note somewhere in our docs
//          about the change when running in the context of Mule.

* Metadata assignment operator. See xref:dw-operators.adoc[].
//TODO: ADD anchored link to section.
//github MERGE: https://github.com/mulesoft/docs-dataweave/pull/211

//List from Slack #data-weave-docs (https://salesforce-internal.slack.com/archives/C011SNL2469/p1670446024214799)

//Typing enhancements: These are all improvements to our typing system meant to allow the reuse of type definitions from other sources.

//JsonSchema support: Users will be able to reference their JSON schemas to define DW types.

//XmlSchema support (@Martín Cousido): Users will be able to reference their XML schemas to define DW types.

//Java support (@Christian Chibana): Users will be able to reference their Java classes to define DW types.



//Attach metadata operator <~ (@Santiago Vacas): This new operator allows to attach metadata to any value and will replace the as syntax that forced type references.

//TODO NOTE on other work (but not in what's new): make sure to point to the metadataOf function for info about when  typeOf is used on a value that has metadata attached.
